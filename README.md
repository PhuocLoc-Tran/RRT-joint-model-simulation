# 🔬 Purpose of the Simulation Study

The simulation experiments evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed joint likelihood framework for modeling:

$$P(Y, Z \mid \boldsymbol{X}) = P(Y \mid \boldsymbol{X}) P(Z \mid Y, \boldsymbol{X}).$$

where:

* $Y$: latent sensitive binary variable collected under the unrelated-question RRT,
* $Z$: observed binary response variable,
* $\boldsymbol{X}$: covariates.

The simulations assess:

* Bias of parameter estimates
* Empirical standard deviation (SD)
* Average asymptotic standard error (ASE)
* Coverage probability (CP) of Wald confidence intervals
* Likelihood ratio test (LRT) performance for testing $H_0: \alpha_0 = \alpha_1$.

All simulation designs correspond exactly to Section 4 of the manuscript.

# 🧪 Simulation Design

Each script implements Monte Carlo experiments under the following settings:

* Sample size: $n \in {1000, 2000}$
* RRT design parameters: $p \in {0.5, 0.7},\ c \in {0.25, 0.5}$
* Number of replications: 1000 (default).

## Case 1

* $X_1$: continuous
* $X_2$: ordinal

## Case 2

* $X_1$: binary
* $X_2$: ordinal

## Case 3

* $X_1$: binary
* $X_2$: binary

The true parameter values used in each scenario match those reported in the manuscript tables.

# ⚙️ Structure of the R Scripts

Each simulation script follows the same workflow:

1. **Generate covariates**
   Simulate $X_1$, $X_2$ according to the specified case.

2. **Generate latent sensitive variable $Y$**
   Using logistic model:
   $$P(Y=1|\boldsymbol{X}) = H(\boldsymbol{\beta}^\top \boldsymbol{X}).$$

3. **Generate observed response $Z$**
   Using conditional model:
   $$P(Z=1|Y=y,\boldsymbol{X}) = H(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_y^\top \boldsymbol{X}).$$

4. **Apply unrelated-question RRT mechanism**
   Generate randomized response $Y^*$.

5. **Estimate parameters using EM algorithm**

   * E-step: compute posterior expectations of $Y$.
   * M-step: update logistic regression parameters.

6. **Compute performance metrics**

   * Bias
   * SD
   * ASE
   * CP
   * LRT rejection frequency.

Extensive inline comments are provided within each script explaining these steps.

# 📊 Output

Each script:

* Runs 1000 Monte Carlo replications
* Stores parameter estimates across replications
* Produces summary tables including:

  * Bias

# 📈 Empirical Example (Section 5)

The empirical analysis is based on the 2012 Taiwan Social Change Survey (TSCS). This survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews by the Center for Survey Research at Academia Sinica, focusing on individuals aged 18 years or older in Taiwan and investigating the prevalence of extramarital affairs. The data are available at https://doi.org/10.6141/TW-SRDA-C00223_2-1 (Chang, 2016). The data set consisted of 1, 838 participants: 945 males and 893 females.

The analysis scripts included here:

* Define the binary variables $Y$, $Z$
* Specify covariates $X_1$, $X_2$.
* Fit the joint model
* Compute parameter estimates and LRT statistics.

Researchers who obtain access to the TSCS data through SRDA can directly reproduce all empirical results.

# 🔁 Reproducibility Notes

* All simulation settings match those described in Section 4 of the paper.
* Random seeds are set to ensure replicability.
* Results may vary slightly due to Monte Carlo variability.
* The EM algorithm implementation follows the likelihood formulation described in Section 3.
